# Uberball
Uberball is a platformer inspired by the golden days of 3D platforming, with a high level of skill required to perfect the game, but a low barrier to complete all the stages. In Uberball, you play as a ball, collect gems to get points, and make it to the goal gem as quickly as possible to get the highest possible score.
